3. Start logging matches.

> Tip: Commit the file to GitHub Pages to get a shareable URL.

## üì§ Import / Export

- **Export** ‚Üí choose **JSON** or **CSV**.  
- **Import** ‚Üí select a `.json` or `.csv` file (auto-detected).  
- JSON format supports either:
  - An array of entries `[{...}, ...]`, **or**
  - An object `{ schema: "dbd1v1.v3", exportedAt, entries: [...] }`.

**CSV columns (required):**
```
id,when,killer,map,opponent,side,result,chaseSurvivor,chaseKiller,notes
```

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Model (localStorage)

Storage key: `dbd1v1_entries_v3`

Each entry:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "when": "2025-09-07T00:30:00.000Z",
  "killer": "Blight",
  "map": "The Game (Gideon)",
  "opponent": "Player123",
  "side": "Killer",                 
  "result": "Win",                  
  "chaseSurvivor": 85,              
  "chaseKiller": 72,                
  "notes": "3 shack mindgames"
}
```

**Compatibility:** v1.2.0 keeps the same schema as v1.1.x.
